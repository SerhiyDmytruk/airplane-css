# Airplane-css
I tried to draw a cartoon airplane using CSS. But I added an animation that I saw on the Internet.

## Originality of the idea
This project is a fork of the
[fan animation](https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/abBedme) 

I wanted to make a plane before this, but I didn't have enough motivation to do it, but when I saw this animation I decided I had to try!

### Discovery

1. I barely found a simple 'Gulp boilerplate' to get started right away. For making' pet projects', it is also worth investing time in defining and finding the necessary tools. [Simple but cool Gulp boilerplate
   ](https://github.com/thecodercoder/frontend-boilerplate)

2. Complexity and some flexibility with properties that help work with forms in CSS;

3. 'clip-path' is a cool property, but very inconvenient and complicated. It is convenient to use if there is a graphic editor, but do it by yourself it is very, very difficult especially to invent and make any shape;

Therefore, I found such a site where you can generate the form you need:
